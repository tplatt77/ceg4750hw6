/**
 * INSTRUCTIONS!!!
 * The concepts of k-anonymity and l-diversity are central to data anonymization. 
 * In this assignment we will explore those concepts and the degree to which they 
 * hold in publicly available datasets in more detail. Write a program to accept a 
 * comma separated value file containing a dataset and a list of which columns in 
 * the dataset are to be considered quasi-identifiers and sensitive attributes. 
 * Your program should find k and l for the dataset. Find a publicly available 
 * dataset and test your code on it.
 * Turn in your source code, the dataset on which you ran your program (include 
 * a link to the original source), the quasi-identifier you used, and the values
 * for k and l.
 * 
 * NOTES:
 * 
 * Separate the functionality into methods. Use classes if necessary or sensible.
 * Need to get the design points
